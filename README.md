# Slapcode
Leetcode, but it really hits ya. *whacc*  
  
Not essentially leetcode style, most of these will have you implement something based on a framework.  
Each problem will have a `README.md` with the Rules and Instructions

## General Rules
(these might be overriden by the problem's rules)  
- You may use nightly
- Follow the spirit of the problems
- May not use external crates (some problems import `rand`, this is just for tests)
- Try to do the most micro-optimizations you can think of
- Don't make it absolutely suck (optional)

## Ideas
- [ ] - bytecode
- [ ] - atomics
- [ ] - segfault
- [ ] - game of life

if ye wanna add one of these, add a new one to this list, or add somethin else feel free to PR! :D
